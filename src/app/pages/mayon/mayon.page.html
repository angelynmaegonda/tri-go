  <p class="paragraph"> A popular tourist spot, it is renowned for its "perfect cone" because of its symmetric conical shape, and is
  regarded as very sacred in Philippine mythology. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The volcano with its surrounding landscape was declared a
  national park on July 20, 1938, the first in the nation. It was reclassified as a natural park and renamed the Mayon Volcano Natural
  Park in 2000 and is currently being nominated as a World Heritage Site. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Mayon is the most active volcano in
  the country, and its activity is regularly monitored by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) from their
  provincial headquarters on Lig√±on Hill, about 12 kilometers from the summit. </p>
