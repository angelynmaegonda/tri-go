    <div class="title"><h3><b>Rizal Park, Manila</b></h3></div>
  </center>

    <p class="paragraph"> It is considered one of the largest urban parks in the Philippines, covering an area of 58 hectares. The site
    on where the park is situated was originally known as Bagumbayan during the Spanish colonial period. It is adjacent to the historic
    walled city of Intramuros. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Situated on the eastern shore of Manila Bay, the park plays a significant role in shaping the
    history of the Philippines. The execution of Filipino patriot, Jos√© Rizal, on December 30, 1896 in the same area fanned the flames of
    the 1896 Philippine Revolution against the Kingdom of Spain. The park was officially named in his honor, and the monument
    enshrining his remains serves as the park's symbolic focal point. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The declaration of Philippine independence from the United States
    was held here on July 4, 1946, as well as later political rallies, including those of Ferdinand Marcos and Corazon Aquino, the
    latter having culminated in the EDSA Revolution in 1986. </p>
