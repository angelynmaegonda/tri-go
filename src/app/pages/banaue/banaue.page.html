    <p class="paragraph"> The terraces are occasionally called the "Eighth Wonder of the World". It is commonly thought that the terraces
    were built with minimal equipment, largely by hand. These are fed by an ancient irrigation system from the rainforests above the
    terraces. It is said that if the steps were put end to end, it would encircle half of the globe. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Anthropologist, Otley Beyer, has estimated that the terraces are over 2000
    years old, but several researchers dispute this and contend that they were built much later. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Locals up to this day still
    plant rice and vegetables on the terraces, although more and more younger Ifugaos do not find farming appealing, often opting
    for the more lucrative hospitality industry generated by the terraces. The result is the gradual erosion of the characteristic
    "steps", which require constant reconstruction and care. </p> <p class="paragraph"> In 2010, a further problem encountered
    was drought, with the terraces drying up completely in March of that year. Current threats to the terraces include the giant
    earthworms ("olang" in Ifugao) which are blamed for causing damage to the terraces, as well as rodents, and snails. </p>
